This is the bash script I quickly put together when I needed to do batch conversion 
of large images into smaller ones to.


It uses ImageMagick to convert the images. I do realise that there's a similar 
script by ImageMagick to do batch conversion, but I didn't know about it at the time of creating 
this script. I needed a quick solution at the moment so made this.
